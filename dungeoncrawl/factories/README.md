# Make Stuff
This section contains all of the (mostly random) generation of stuff. So far it's got a `names.NameFactory` and a `loot.LootFactory` that generate... you guessed it, names and loot. As of the writing of this readme, the `LootFactory` isn't actually creating any loot, but it's there in spirit/placeholder. The idea is that we can call on these kinds of factories to make all the stuff we need for the board.

The `NameFactory` can generate fantasy-sounding and -looking names either randomly or from seed names. I've played with this thing for... longer than I care to admit because it's always funny when it goes from something like `"Gallarxora"` to `"Frank"`, or when the random letter replaces really show, like `"Juffury"`. It's a hoot, give it a shot. --And improve it!
